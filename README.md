### Overview

This is just a quick repo I made to hold and remember my answers through this years "Advent of Code" by _Eric Wastl_.

> [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
